## Project Description

In this project, we:

1. Conducted extensive data exploration, cleaning, and visualization to extract insights on customer behavior.
2. Applied K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers.
3. Used silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. Identified key features that differentiate the clusters.
5. Visualized cluster characteristics based on random forest feature importance.

This analysis provides valuable insights into different customer segments, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for K-Means clustering and Random Forest
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## Results

Our analysis identified four distinct customer segments. Key findings include:

1. Cluster 0: The Frequent, Satisfied Browser
   - Primarily women in their early 30s
   - Regular shoppers who browse a few times a week and purchase a few times a month
   - Highly value customer reviews and find them mostly accurate
   - Moderate level of shopping satisfaction
   - Areas for improvement: Customer service responsiveness

2. Cluster 1: The Youthful, Infrequent Shopper
   - Younger women in their mid-20s
   - Shop less frequently but highly engaged when they do
   - Rely heavily on customer reviews
   - Often add items to cart while browsing
   - Areas for improvement: Product quality and accuracy

3. Cluster 2: The Frequent but Dissatisfied Shopper
   - Women in their early 30s
   - Shop frequently but have the lowest satisfaction levels
   - Often browse and purchase
   - Appreciate competitive prices
   - Areas for improvement: Product quality and accuracy

4. Cluster 3: The Selective, Satisfied Male Shopper
   - Men in their mid-30s
   - Shop infrequently but are highly satisfied when they do
   - Highly value customer reviews and find ratings very accurate
   - Appreciate the user-friendly website/app interface
   - Areas for improvement: Shipping speed and reliability

Key features differentiating the clusters include:
- Add to Cart Browsing behavior
- Customer Reviews Importance
- Purchase Frequency
- Review Helpfulness
- Age
- Product Search Method
- Shopping Satisfaction
- Cart Completion Frequency
- Rating Accuracy
- Personalized Recommendation Frequency

These insights can be used to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and address specific needs of each segment.
